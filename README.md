chrome - v8
ie - chakra
firefox - spidermonkey

ECMA scripts - European Country Association
deals with scripting languages
decides what features js should have
they come up with the versions

ES6, ES7, 2018 - specifications/standards


babel - transpires
it converts the equivalent code from one standard to backward standards

polyfill js - when there is no equivalent feature in older versions

webpack - creates one file out of many, bundling
maven

node js - runtime for js based on V8
executes js code outside of a browser

ember, 

lambda functional programming


js - functional programming language
everything is function
function is first class citizen

graphql - can request only few fields to the server to return

bootstrap

npm

nodemon - good for development 
axios - invoking rest calls

npm install axios --save

npm install -- looks for package.json and download all the dependencies on distribution


vue

handlebars
thymeleaf

reactjs - single page architecture

node package management - similar to maven

npm install -g create-react-app
cli tool - command line interface for react projects

C:\Users\PriyankaKeshari\AppData\Roaming\npm


responsive design - breakpoints

React - library
targets view
MVVM - Model to view, View to model
Single page application
View is always backed by models

we create components
browser compatibility is taken care by react-  as it is built on babel

Virtual DOM(made of json objects) - abstraction of HTML DOM
React's local simplified copy of actual html dom
When something changes, virtual dom is updated

npm install -g create-react-app

create-react-app <appname>

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd helloreact
  npm start

Component will have view + functionality (View + Model)
function component - stateless
class components - stateful
ref
createref
state - setstate
Routers
npm install --save react-router-dom

REST - architectural style to create web services
intraoperability
